         <p>
                      Observant<br>
                    Paying a close attention to things around me; I look and listen more than I talk.<br>
                 Patient<br>
                     I am a pretty calm person, and I know that not everything in life will work at a pace that you hope or wish it to.<br>
                 A Positive-attitude<br>
                      Having a positive-attitude in life helps me to look on the brighter side and to continue pushing myself, <br>it also keep that stress level to a minimum
         </p> 
         <p>Over the past years I can positively say that I have been constantly developing myself in these areas.<br><br>
        So much so that I develop on them everyday without even knowing; it's just a part of me. I am always observing my surroundings,<br>
         being optimistic and having a positive outlook on life can greatly reduce stress and depression levels. <br>
    Being patient; yeah why not just wait it out?  </p>

    <h3><a name="section1"  href=""><strong>Twelve Pillars by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener</strong></a></h3>
            <p>After reading the Twelve Pillars, I have been doing a number of reflections on my life and where i want to go in life.
                The Twelve Pillars focused on principles that are aimed at improving one's life. Of the twelve pillars, I will make mention of four: Goals, Time, Surrounding Oneself with the Best People and Life-long Education.
                <ol type="I">
                    <li>Goals- Always write down your goals. Writing goals ensure your mind cognitively aware of the goal set and begins thinking of ways to acheive such goals</li>
                    <li>Time- There are 24 hours within a day, how and what you decide to do within those 24 hours should reflect or align with your goals. It is best to have a schedule or have a method in which you control your time. </li>
                    <li>Surround Yourself with the Best People- On a daily basis we tend to surround ourselves with those we love, those we consider close to us. We tend to spend a lot of time with such persons, however, ensure they have your best interests at heart.
                                                                Surround yourself with people who will empower you, give you the drive and influence you need to become a better person.</li>
                    <li>Life-Long Education- Learning is a life-long process, or it should be. Never shy away from learning something new, whatever you learn in this journey called life is what makes you constantly grow and improve.</li>
                </ol>
